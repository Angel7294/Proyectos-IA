Psychological Help Diagnosis
This project provides a simple GUI to diagnose psychological symptoms and provide potential help or treatment options based on the diagnosis. The project uses a neural network model that has been trained on psychological symptom data to provide the diagnosis.

Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

shelve
tensorflow
tkinter
scikit-learn
Usage
To use the project, run the main() function in the code. This will open a GUI window where you can select your language and the symptoms you are experiencing along with their intensity. Once you click on the "Diagn√≥stico" button, the program will display the diagnosis and potential treatment options.

Model
The neural network model used in this project has been trained on a dataset of psychological symptom data. The model consists of two dense layers with 50 and 1 neurons respectively, and uses the mean squared error loss function with the Adam optimizer.

Data
The data used to train the model is stored in a shelve database file named "psychological_help_database". If no data is found in the database, the program will start from scratch.

Please note that this project is not a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment. If you are experiencing severe psychological symptoms, please seek help from a licensed mental health professional.
